# Real-time Event Detection in Twitter
In the last few years, Twitter has become a popular platform for sharing opinions,
experiences, news, and views in real-time. Twitter presents an interesting opportunity for
detecting events happening around the real-world events. The content (tweets) published on
Twitter are short and pose diverse challenges for detecting and interpreting event-related
information. Twitter can produce rich data streams for immediate insights into ongoing
matters and the conversations around them to tackle the problem. There are various
technique available in previous work for detecting an event from twitter data stream such as
feature pivot, document pivot, topic modeling. In this project we have done entity extraction
entity filtering, computing of similarity between entity and entity clustering to get the final
output.

# Entity Based Approach to Detect the Events
1. Entity Extraction
2. Entity filtering
3. Computing similarity
4. Similarity filtering
5. Entity graph generation
6. Clustering
7. Cluster chaining
